Nearly finished with minimum viable functionality

2/27/2017
Base functionality achieved!
- loads and saves entries to internal storage
- sorts entries by closest due date
- add and clear entries

TODO:
- change main layout to have all necessary inputs
- the saving and sorting code needs to be better written; can be simplified
- clean up code for version 1.0

Bonus Features:
- Project entries functionality and sub-project entries
- Daily/Weekly list options for entries that should reappear every day/week/etc
- edit entry functionality
- make a widget for the home screen to display nearest due entries
- create, save, and load pre-made lists

Aesthetics:
- animate clearing checked entries
- make the add new entry screen nicer
- the newEntry screen appears as a dialog box instead of a new screen
- add color theme selection functionality
- add click indicator for buttons

Note:
- Order of screen return: activity gets result -> onResume executes
